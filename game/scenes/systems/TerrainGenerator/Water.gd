# Hooke's Law is F = -k * x where F is the force, k is the spring constant, and x is the displacement of the spring from its rest position.
# Loss = -d * v where d is the damping constant and v is the velocity of the spring.
# Displacement of adjectent nodes is xAdj = x * r where r is the radiating constant.
